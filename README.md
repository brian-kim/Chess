# Chess (WIP)
A chess game built with react using [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

**Note: This is still very much a work in progress.**

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the project directory and run the command `npm start` to begin.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to play the game.

## Deployment
To deploy the app, run `npm run build` in the project directory. <br />
See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) for more information.

Enjoy!
